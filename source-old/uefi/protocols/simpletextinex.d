/**
	The function reads the next keystroke from the input device. If
	there is no pending keystroke the function returns
	EFI_NOT_READY. If there is a pending keystroke, then
	KeyData.Key.ScanCode is the EFI scan code defined in Error!
	Reference source not found. The KeyData.Key.UnicodeChar is the
	actual printable character or is zero if the key does not
	represent a printable character (control key, function key,
	etc.). The KeyData.KeyState is shift state for the character
	reflected in KeyData.Key.UnicodeChar or KeyData.Key.ScanCode .
	When interpreting the data from this function, it should be
	noted that if a class of printable characters that are
	normally adjusted by shift modifiers (e.g. Shift Key + "f"
	key) would be presented solely as a KeyData.Key.UnicodeChar
	without the associated shift state. So in the previous example
	of a Shift Key + "f" key being pressed, the only pertinent
	data returned would be KeyData.Key.UnicodeChar with the value
	of "F". This of course would not typically be the case for
	non-printable characters such as the pressing of the Right
	Shift Key + F10 key since the corresponding returned data
	would be reflected both in the KeyData.KeyState.KeyShiftState
	and KeyData.Key.ScanCode values. UEFI drivers which implement
	the EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_INPUT_EX protocol are required to return
	KeyData.Key and KeyData.KeyState values. These drivers must
	always return the most current state of
	KeyData.KeyState.KeyShiftState and
	KeyData.KeyState.KeyToggleState. It should also be noted that
	certain input devices may not be able to produce shift or toggle
	state information, and in those cases the high order bit in the
	respective Toggle and Shift state fields should not be active.
